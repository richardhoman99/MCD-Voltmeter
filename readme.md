The goal of the PCB Design project is to encourage the student understand the family of tools in KiCad. This is accomplished by having the student design a voltmeter, based on a ready made voltmeter design. To have the student focus only on design and process, a bill of materials is provided. Some of the most important items include a Xilinx XC9572XL series CPLD, an ECS 5032MV series oscillator, and two LP3869 family voltage regulators.  
The student also must program the CPLD controller. This is done using Xilinx ISE Webpack and VHDL as the HDL.  
Only the VHD source files are present in this repository.
